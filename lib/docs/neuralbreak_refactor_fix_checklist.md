Let's break down how to transition your current `lib` directory into the recommended structure.

### From Your Structure To Recommended Structure: A Step-by-Step Guide

Here's a mapping of your current files/folders to the new structure, along with actionable steps.

**Your Current Structure Focus:**

* `lib/game`: Seems to contain most of your game logic and components.
* `lib/screens`: Your UI screens.
* `lib/widgets`: UI elements, possibly with some game interaction widgets.
* `lib/assets`: Already well-organized.
* `lib/data`: Currently empty, good for future use.

**Recommended Structure Recap:**

```
lib/
├── core/
├── data/
│   ├── datasources/
│   └── repositories/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   ├── repositories/
│   └── usecases/
├── features/
│   ├── gameplay/
│   │   ├── data/
│   │   ├── domain/
│   │   └── presentation/
│   ├── main_menu/
│   └── scores/
├── main.dart
```

### Step-by-Step Migration Plan

**Phase 1: Setup Core & Initial Feature Folders**

1.  **Create Core Directories:**
    * Create `lib/core/constants/`
    * Create `lib/core/error/`
    * Create `lib/core/routes/`
    * Create `lib/core/services/`
    * Create `lib/core/widgets/`

2.  **Create Feature Directories:**
    * Create `lib/features/gameplay/`
    * Inside `lib/features/gameplay/`:
        * Create `data/datasources/`
        * Create `data/repositories/`
        * Create `domain/entities/`
        * Create `domain/repositories/`
        * Create `domain/usecases/`
        * Create `presentation/bloc/` (or `provider`/`riverpod` based on your state management choice)
        * Create `presentation/pages/`
        * Create `presentation/widgets/`
    * Create `lib/features/main_menu/presentation/pages/` (for `main.dart`'s initial screen)
    * Create `lib/features/scores/` (for high scores)
        * Inside `lib/features/scores/`:
            * Create `data/datasources/`
            * Create `data/repositories/`
            * Create `domain/entities/`
            * Create `domain/repositories/`
            * Create `domain/usecases/`
            * Create `presentation/bloc/`
            * Create `presentation/pages/`
            * Create `presentation/widgets/`

**Phase 2: Migrate Core Utilities**

1.  **`lib/game/util/game_constants.dart`**:*
    * **Move To:** `lib/core/constants/game_constants.dart`
    * **Action:** This file contains global constants like game speed, gravity, etc. These are typically `core` level.

2.  **`lib/game/util/game_states.dart`**:*
    * **Move To:** `lib/core/constants/game_states.dart` (if simple enums) or `lib/core/bloc/game_state_event.dart` (if part of a BLoC system).
    * **Action:** If these are just enums representing game states, `constants` is fine. If they are more complex state objects, they might belong closer to a state management solution in `core/` or `features/gameplay/presentation/bloc/`. For now, `constants` is a safe bet.

3.  **`lib/game_structure.md`**:*
    * **Move To:** `docs/project_structure.md` (create `docs` folder at project root).
    * **Action:** This is project documentation, not code.

**Phase 3: Migrate Game Components & Logic (`lib/game`)**

This is the most significant part. We'll primarily map your `lib/game` contents to `lib/features/gameplay/`.

1.  **`lib/game/neural_break_game.dart`**:
    * **Move To:** `lib/features/gameplay/presentation/pages/neural_break_game_page.dart` (or similar, if it's the main FlameGame widget)
    * **Action:** This is likely your main Flame game instance. It should be considered the "page" or primary widget for the gameplay feature.

2.  **`lib/game/components/`**:
    * **`player.dart`, `firewall.dart`, `obstacle.dart`, `obstacle_types`**:
        * **Move To (Domain Entities):** `lib/features/gameplay/domain/entities/player.dart`, `firewall.dart`, `obstacle.dart`, etc.
        * **Action:** These are the core "things" in your game world. They define the data and basic behavior of your game objects. They are the `entities`.
    * **`player_jump.dart`, `player_movement.dart`, `player_slide.dart`**:
        * **Move To (Domain Usecases/Components):** `lib/features/gameplay/domain/usecases/player_jump_usecase.dart`, `player_move_usecase.dart`, `player_slide_usecase.dart`. Or, if these are behaviors directly attached to the Flame `Player` component, keep them close to the Player component but within the `gameplay` feature.
        * **Action:** These are likely behaviors or actions the player can perform. In Clean Architecture, complex actions often become `usecases`. If they are simple mixins that modify a component's behavior, they can stay as part of the component definition or be moved to `features/gameplay/presentation/components` if they are Flame-specific `Component`s. For now, assume `usecases` or components.
    * **`obstacle_spawner.dart`**:
        * **Move To (Domain Usecases/Presentation Components):** `lib/features/gameplay/domain/usecases/spawn_obstacle_usecase.dart` and/or `lib/features/gameplay/presentation/components/obstacle_spawner_component.dart`.
        * **Action:** The *logic* of spawning (what, when, where) belongs in a usecase. The *actual Flame component* that executes this logic might remain as a component.

3.  **`lib/game/managers/`**:
    * **`game_controller.dart`, `game_state_manager.dart`**:
        * **Move To (Presentation Bloc/Controllers):** `lib/features/gameplay/presentation/bloc/game_bloc.dart` or `game_controller.dart`.
        * **Action:** These manage the overall state and flow of the game. They are prime candidates for your state management solution (BLoC, Riverpod, Provider).
    * **`component_manager.dart`, `input_manager.dart`, `life_manager.dart`, `obstacle_pool.dart`, `scene_manager.dart`, `score_manager.dart`, `ui_manager.dart`**:
        * **Move To (Domain Usecases / Presentation Controllers/Services):**
            * `score_manager.dart`, `life_manager.dart`: Logic for score and life management should be in `lib/features/gameplay/domain/usecases/`. For example, `UpdateScoreUsecase`, `HandlePlayerDamageUsecase`.
            * `obstacle_pool.dart`: This is a data structure/optimization. It could be in `lib/features/gameplay/data/datasources/obstacle_pool.dart` (if it manages the actual data of obstacles) or `lib/features/gameplay/presentation/components/obstacle_pool_component.dart` (if it's a Flame component).
            * `input_manager.dart`: Logic for processing inputs would be in `lib/features/gameplay/domain/usecases/handle_input_usecase.dart`. The actual input listener would be in `presentation`.
            * `component_manager.dart`, `scene_manager.dart`, `ui_manager.dart`: These sound like Flame-specific orchestrators. They should likely reside in `lib/features/gameplay/presentation/controllers/` or `lib/features/gameplay/presentation/components/` (if they are Flame components). They orchestrate how the game's visual and interactive elements are rendered and updated.

**Phase 4: Migrate Screens & Widgets**

1.  **`lib/screens/game_screen.dart`**:
    * **Move To:** `lib/features/gameplay/presentation/pages/game_screen.dart`
    * **Action:** This is the main Flutter UI screen where your game runs.

2.  **`lib/widgets/avatars/`**:
    * **`avatar_display_widget.dart`, `pulse_runner_controller.dart`, `pulse_runner_jump.dart`, `pulse_runner_running.dart`, `pulse_runner_slide.dart`**:
        * **Move To:** `lib/features/gameplay/presentation/widgets/avatars/`
        * **Action:** These are UI-specific widgets for displaying the player character. They belong in the `presentation` layer of the `gameplay` feature.

3.  **`lib/widgets/game_host_widget.dart`, `game_widget.dart`, `game_widget_wrapper.dart`**:
    * **Move To:** `lib/features/gameplay/presentation/widgets/` or `lib/features/gameplay/presentation/pages/`
    * **Action:** These seem to be wrappers or host widgets for your Flame game. They should go into the `presentation` layer of the `gameplay` feature. `game_widget.dart` is likely the primary wrapper around `NeuralBreakGame`.

**Phase 5: Remaining Top-Level Files**

1.  **`main.dart`**:
    * **Keep as is**, but modify to import and use the new `features` structure (e.g., `runApp(const MainMenuPage());`).
    * **Action:** This is your app's entry point. It will likely instantiate a `MaterialApp` and route to your main menu or game screen from the new `features/` paths.

2.  **`lib/assets/`**:
    * **Keep as is.**
    * **Action:** This is already well-placed and doesn't need to change.

3.  **`lib/data/` (Currently Empty)**:
    * **Action:** This can remain empty for now. It will be used later for `datasources` and `repositories` that are *not* specific to a single feature (e.g., a global user profile database, or a generic analytics service). For now, feature-specific data handling goes inside `features/<feature_name>/data`.

### Refactoring Strategy

* **One File at a Time:** Don't try to move everything at once. Pick one file, move it to its new location, update its imports, and fix any immediate compilation errors.
* **Use Your IDE's Refactoring Tools:** Most IDEs (VS Code, Android Studio/IntelliJ) have excellent "Move" and "Rename" refactoring capabilities that will automatically update imports. Use them!
* **Run Tests (If You Have Them):** If you have tests, run them frequently to ensure functionality isn't broken. If you don't, this refactor is a good opportunity to start adding some unit tests for your `domain/usecases`.
* **Git Commits:** Make frequent, small, descriptive commits. "Moved Player to entities", "Refactored ScoreManager to usecase". This makes it easier to revert if you make a mistake.
* **Prioritize Game Logic First:** Start by identifying your core game entities and their behaviors (your `components` and `managers`) and move them into the `gameplay/domain` and `gameplay/presentation` layers.
* **Clean Up Old Folders:** Once a folder is completely empty, delete it.

This process will take time and patience, but the resulting organized structure will make your project much easier to understand, maintain, and extend in the long run. Good luck!
