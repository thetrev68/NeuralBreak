### Project Structure Overview

#### **1. Main Application & UI Shell (`lib/main.dart`)**

* **`main.dart`**: This is the entry point of your entire Flutter application.
    * It sets up the basic Flutter app (`MaterialApp`).
    * It creates and hosts your core `NeuralBreakGame` instance using Flame's `GameWidget`.
    * Crucially, it handles the Flutter UI **overlays** like the score, level, and lives display, positioning them relative to your game screen.
    * It also embeds the `AvatarDisplayWidget`.

#### **2. Game Core (`lib/game/neural_break_game.dart`)**

* **`neural_break_game.dart`** (Assumed main game class): This is the heart of your game logic, extending `FlameGame`.
    * It initializes and manages all your game components (like the player, obstacles, background).
    * It integrates various "managers" (`InputManager`, `UIManager`, `ScoreManager`, `LifeManager`).
    * It defines the game's overall size and lifecycle.

#### **3. Player Mechanics (Flame Components & Mixins)**

These files define *how* your player behaves within the game world. They are typically mixed into a central `Player` component.

* **`player.dart`** (Assumed main player component): This component likely extends `PositionComponent` (from Flame) and mixes in the behavior defined by `PlayerMovement`, `PlayerJump`, and `PlayerSlide`. It's the entity that moves, jumps, and slides.
* **`player_movement.dart`**: A "mixin" that adds horizontal lane-switching logic to your player. It uses `game_constants.dart` to determine speeds and lane positions.
* **`player_jump.dart`**: A "mixin" that adds vertical jumping physics (initial force, gravity, landing detection) to your player. It also uses `game_constants.dart` for jump force and gravity values. It communicates with `player_slide.dart` to prevent simultaneous actions.
* **`player_slide.dart`**: A "mixin" that adds sliding behavior, temporarily changing the player's size and managing the slide duration. It uses `game_constants.dart` for slide dimensions and duration. It communicates with `player_jump.dart`.

#### **4. Game Managers (`lib/game/managers/`)**

These classes handle specific aspects of the game logic and state.

* **`input_manager.dart`**: Responsible for processing user input (like keyboard presses or screen taps) and translating them into actions for your `Player` component (e.g., `moveLeft()`, `jump()`).
* **`ui_manager.dart`** (Assumed): Manages the visual state of your user interface. It likely controls which `PulseRunner` avatar pose (`running`, `jump`, `slide`) is currently displayed. It interacts with `PulseRunnerController`.
* **`score_manager.dart`** (Assumed from `main.dart`): Tracks and updates the player's score and current level. It provides `ValueNotifier`s that `main.dart` listens to for UI updates.
* **`life_manager.dart`** (Assumed from `main.dart`): Tracks and updates the player's remaining lives. It also provides a `ValueNotifier` for UI updates in `main.dart`.

#### **5. Avatar Visuals (`lib/widgets/avatars/`)**

These files are specifically for drawing the player's animated stick figure using Flutter's `CustomPainter`s.

* **`avatar_display_widget.dart`**: A Flutter widget that acts as a container for displaying the correct `PulseRunner` pose. It listens to the `UIManager` to know which pose to show and then renders the appropriate `PulseRunnerRunning`, `PulseRunnerJump`, or `PulseRunnerSlide` widget.
* **`pulse_runner_controller.dart`**: This class (a `ChangeNotifier`) manages the *animation state* for the `PulseRunner`. It holds `AnimationController`s and `Animation` objects that dictate the angles of the avatar's limbs for different poses (running, jumping, sliding). The `AvatarDisplayWidget` uses this to update its visual.
* **`pulse_runner_running.dart`**: Contains the `CustomPainter` logic for drawing the `PulseRunner` in its animated running pose. It receives animation values from `PulseRunnerController`.
* **`pulse_runner_jump.dart`**: Contains the `CustomPainter` logic for drawing the `PulseRunner` in its static jumping pose.
* **`pulse_runner_slide.dart`**: Contains the `CustomPainter` logic for drawing the `PulseRunner` in its static sliding pose. (This is where the `unused_local_variable` error was, now hopefully resolved by using scalable coordinates).

#### **6. Utility & Configuration (`lib/game/util/`)**

* **`game_constants.dart`**: This is a crucial file for centralizing all your game's numerical values (speeds, sizes, durations, gravity, initial lives, etc.) and helper enums/functions (`GameLane`, `getLaneX`, `getGroundY`). Many other files (`player_movement`, `player_jump`, `player_slide`, `main`) reference these constants.

#### **7. Game Widget Wrappers (`lib/widgets/`)**

These are Flutter widgets that wrap the core Flame `GameWidget` for various purposes.

* **`game_host_widget.dart`** (Potentially superseded by `RootWidget`'s current role in `main.dart`): An older or alternative Flutter widget that would primarily host the `FlameGame` instance.
* **`game_widget.dart`**: This widget often acts as a wrapper around Flame's built-in `GameWidget`. It might add functionalities like keyboard listeners, touch detectors, or other Flutter-specific widgets that need to interact with the game. It uses `game_widget_wrapper.dart`.
* **`game_widget_wrapper.dart`**: A simple widget that directly contains Flame's `GameWidget`. This layering allows for easier separation of concerns, especially if you need to add Flutter widgets on top or around the game canvas.
