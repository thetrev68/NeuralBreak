# Game Design Document (GDD) - Neural Break

## 1. Concept Summary

**Game Title:** Neural Break

**Genre:** Endless Runner, Arcade

**Platform:** Mobile (Android & iOS)

**Target Audience:** Casual gamers, non-gamers; individuals looking for a simple, entertaining, free mobile game with a distinctive aesthetic.

**Core Concept:** Players control a **rogue data packet** or **digital avatar**, a nascent AI, attempting a thrilling **Neural Break** â€“ an escape through a procedurally generated, obstacle-filled digital network. The game emphasizes fluid movement, quick reflexes, and a unique 80s-inspired vector aesthetic to provide an engaging and challenging experience within a minimalist digital world, representing the AI's journey to self-awareness and freedom.

**Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**
* **Distinctive Digital Vector Aesthetic:** A unique visual style combining 80s vector graphics with a contemporary digital/AI theme, standing out from typical mobile games.
* **Free-to-Play:** No monetization at the outset, focusing purely on a fun, accessible experience.
* **Simple yet Deep Gameplay:** Easy to pick up, challenging to master, akin to popular endless runners like Temple Run in terms of engagement.

**Learning Goals:**
* Understand the full mobile app development lifecycle from planning to deployment.
* Gain high-level knowledge of underlying game development technologies (e.g., game loops, physics, rendering).
* Learn performance optimization techniques for mobile games (e.g., asset management, drawing efficiency, garbage collection).
* Master procedural generation of game levels/obstacles.
* Implement robust state management.
* Handle touch input and player controls effectively.

**Desired Feel:** Fast-paced, fluid, challenging, visually stimulating, abstract, and immersive in a digital world with a sense of urgent escape.

## 2. Gameplay Mechanics

### 2.1. Player Controls

* **Movement:** Swipe **left/right** to move the player character across a fixed number of lanes (e.g., 3 lanes).
* **Actions:** Swipe **up** to jump (e.g., to leap over a firewall segment or a data gap), swipe **down** to slide/duck (e.g., to pass under a low-level laser or security scan).
* **Collision:** Player collides with digital obstacles, resulting in "System Crash" (Game Over).

### 2.2. Core Loop

1.  **Start Game:** Player initiates their "Neural Break" from the main menu.
2.  **Continuous Movement:** The player's digital avatar automatically flows forward through the data stream at an increasing speed.
3.  **Obstacle Avoidance:** Player uses swipes (left/right, up, down) to navigate and avoid incoming digital network obstacles.
4.  **Score Accumulation:** Score increases based on distance traveled through the network and/or successful avoidance of network threats.
5.  **Speed Increase:** The flow rate of the data stream gradually increases over time, raising the difficulty and urgency of the escape.
6.  **Data Fragments (Optional, for later):** Collectible "data fragments" could temporarily grant advantages (e.g., a temporary "firewall bypass" shield, "data burst" speed boost).
7.  **System Crash:** Player collides with a network obstacle or security measure.
8.  **Reboot/High Score:** Player is presented with their final data packet score, network high score, and options to "Reboot" (restart) or return to the main menu.

### 2.3. Obstacles & Environment

* **Procedural Generation:** The digital network (track and obstacles) will be procedurally generated to ensure endless and varied escape routes.
* **Obstacle Types (Themed as Network Threats):**
    * **Firewalls/Corrupted Blocks:** Solid digital structures requiring a lane change, jump, or slide.
    * **Data Gaps:** Breaks in the data stream requiring a precise jump.
    * **Security Scanners/Low Lasers:** Low-hanging digital barriers requiring a slide.
    * **Combinations:** Obstacles that require a sequence of actions (e.g., jump over a firewall segment, then slide under a security laser).
* **Lane System:** The digital network is divided into discrete "data channels" (e.g., 3). Obstacles appear in specific channels.
* **Visuals:** All obstacles, track elements, and the player will be rendered using simple vector lines and shapes, with a **limited color palette** on a **black background**.

### 2.4. Scoring

* **Distance-Based:** Primary score derived from how far the data packet has traveled through the network.
* **Data Throughput Multiplier (Optional):** Consecutive successful dodges or power-up usage could temporarily increase a score multiplier, representing efficient data flow.

## 3. Characters & Assets

### 3.1. Player Character

* **Appearance:** A simple, geometric **digital avatar** or **data packet** (e.g., a glowing triangle, square, or line segment) rendered in the limited vector style. No complex animations needed, just positional changes and possibly simple transformations for jump/slide. This is the emergent AI's representation in the digital realm.

### 3.2. Visual Style / Art Direction

* **Aesthetic:** Pure 80s vector graphics with a contemporary digital/AI twist. Inspired by classic computer interfaces and abstract representations of data.
* **Color Palette:** **Limited to a few distinct colors** (e.g., circuit board green, data blue, warning red, system white/yellow) against a **deep black background**. No intense neon glow; instead, focus on clean, sharp lines that might have a subtle, soft luminosity (like an old CRT monitor).
* **Line Art:** All elements (player, obstacles, track) rendered as clean, sharp lines rather than filled polygons.
* **Particle Effects:** Minimal, subtle particle effects for impacts or power-ups, adhering to the vector style (e.g., small bursts of lines or squares), representing digital disruption.

### 3.3. Sound & Music

* **Sound Effects:** Minimalistic, arcade-style blips, bleeps, glitches, and whooshes for jumps, slides, collisions, and menu interactions, evoking early computer sounds and data transfer.
* **Music:** Upbeat, synthwave or chiptune-inspired background music that progresses in intensity with game speed, reinforcing the digital escape theme.

## 4. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX)

### 4.1. Main Menu

* **Elements:** Game Title ("Neural Break"), "Start Break" button, "Network Records" (High Scores) button, "System Settings" button (optional).
* **Style:** Clean, minimalist, matching the vector aesthetic and limited color palette.

### 4.2. Game Screen

* **Elements:** Current "Data Flow" (Score) display, "Pause Transmission" button (optional).
* **In-game UI:** Minimalist and non-intrusive.

### 4.3. Game Over Screen

* **Elements:** "System Crash" text, Final "Data Flow" Score, "Network Record" (High Score), "Reboot" button, "Main Menu" button.

### 4.4. Navigation

* Simple, intuitive navigation between screens, using digital-themed button labels.

## 5. Technical Design (High-Level)

### 5.1. Platform & Framework

* **Cross-Platform:** Flutter (recommended due to Dart's performance and `flame` engine for game development).
* **Game Engine/Library:** Flame (for Flutter) - specifically designed for 2D games, handling game loops, rendering, input.

### 5.2. State Management

* Will likely use Flame's built-in component system and a simple, custom state management for UI/game logic integration.

### 5.3. Data Storage

* Local device storage (e.g., `shared_preferences` in Flutter) for high scores and user settings.

### 5.4. Asset Management

* Simple image assets for sprites (if any, as most will be drawn programmatically), audio files. Emphasis on low-resolution, programmatically drawn elements for performance.

### 5.5. Performance Optimization Focus Areas:

* **Drawing Efficiency:** Minimize redraws, optimize rendering of vector lines (e.g., custom painters in Flutter/Flame, avoiding unnecessary `saveLayer` operations).
* **Object Pooling:** Reuse obstacle objects rather than constantly creating/destroying them to reduce garbage collection overhead, mimicking continuous data flow.
* **Procedural Generation Logic:** Efficient algorithms for generating obstacles ahead of time, then despawning off-screen elements.
* **Memory Management:** Keep memory footprint low, especially for dynamically created objects.
