### Proposed Folder & File Structure for `lib/`

This structure aims to separate core game logic from UI screens, assets, and utilities, while leveraging Flame's component-based nature.

```
lib/
├── main.dart                 # Application entry point. Sets up the main Flutter app and GameWidget.
|
├── game/                     # All core game logic and components for Neural Break
│   ├── neural_break_game.dart # The main FlameGame class (e.g., `NeuralBreakGame`).
│   ├── components/           # Specific game entities that are Flame components
│   │   ├── player.dart       # The player's digital avatar.
│   │   ├── obstacle.dart     # Base class for all obstacles (firewalls, gaps, scanners).
│   │   ├── obstacle_types/   # Specific implementations of obstacles
│   │   │   ├── firewall_block.dart
│   │   │   ├── data_gap.dart
│   │   │   └── security_scanner.dart
│   │   └── background_elements.dart # Visual elements that scroll but aren't obstacles.
│   │
│   ├── managers/             # Classes managing game state, logic, and systems
│   │   ├── game_manager.dart # Overall game state (running, paused, game over), score, speed.
│   │   ├── obstacle_spawner.dart # Handles procedural generation and spawning of obstacles.
│   │   ├── collision_manager.dart # (Optional, if collision logic is complex) Handles collision responses.
│   │   └── score_manager.dart # (Optional, if score logic is complex beyond game_manager)
│   │
│   ├── util/                 # Game-specific utilities, constants, enums
│   │   ├── game_constants.dart # Speed multipliers, lane positions, initial values.
│   │   ├── game_colors.dart    # Your specific limited color palette.
│   │   ├── collision_block.dart # Enum for collision types (Player, Obstacle, DataFragment).
│   │   └── helpers.dart        # Game-specific helper functions (e.g., screen-to-world conversions).
│   │
│   └── world/                # Defines the game world/level structure
│       └── game_world.dart   # Encapsulates the track, lanes, and how they interact.
│
├── assets/                   # Non-code assets (managed by pubspec.yaml)
│   ├── audio/                # Game sound effects and music
│   │   ├── sfx_jump.mp3
│   │   ├── sfx_collision.mp3
│   │   └── bgm_loop.mp3
│   │
│   └── images/               # Any static images (e.g., if you use spritesheets, but mostly programmatic for vectors)
│       └── ui_background.png
│
├── data/                     # Data models and persistence
│   ├── app_data.dart         # Class to hold application-wide data (e.g., high scores, settings).
│   └── high_score_storage.dart # Handles saving/loading high scores using shared_preferences.
│
└── screens/                  # UI screens outside of the main game loop
    ├── main_menu_screen.dart # The initial main menu screen.
    ├── game_over_screen.dart # Displays score, high score, and play again button.
    └── settings_screen.dart  # Controls for sound, music, etc. (optional).

### Explanation of Key Directories:

* **`lib/game/`**: This is the heart of your Flame game logic. Keeping it separate from general Flutter UI makes your project highly organized.
    * **`neural_break_game.dart`**: Your main `FlameGame` instance. This class will orchestrate all other game components and managers.
    * **`components/`**: Houses all your `PositionComponent`, `SpriteComponent`, or `ShapeComponent` classes. Each distinct entity in your game (player, a specific type of obstacle) gets its own file here.
        * `obstacle_types/`: A sub-directory to keep different obstacle implementations organized.
    * **`managers/`**: Contains classes that handle specific overarching game logic, like procedural generation, score tracking, or state management, that might not directly be Flame components but interact heavily with them.
    * **`util/`**: For shared constants, enums, helper functions specific to the *game* part of your app.
    * **`world/`**: For defining the properties and structure of your game's world, like the lane system, instead of directly hardcoding it into the spawner or player.

* **`lib/assets/`**: Standard Flutter practice for managing static files. Remember to declare these in your `pubspec.yaml`.

* **`lib/data/`**: For managing persistent data like high scores or user settings.

* **`lib/screens/`**: For all the non-gameplay Flutter UI screens that wrap your `GameWidget`. Your game will typically transition between these "screens" (Main Menu, Game Over) and the active `GameWidget` that displays `NeuralBreakGame`.
